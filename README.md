# Netzgut Contribution Guide

We would be really happy if you want to contribute to any of our projects! feel
free to open issues or provide pull requests.

## IDE settings

To ensure the best code readability and consistency we would kindly ask to use our
coding style if you provide any code. In this repository you can find our cleanup
and code formatter settings for Eclipse 4.6 Neon, our IDE of choice.

Of course you can provide could that isn't formatted regarding this guidelines but
the possibility is high that we might ignore/reject your pull request without getting
in too deep into the code ;-)
